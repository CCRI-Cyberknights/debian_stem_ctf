# 📡 Challenge 17: Nmap Scan Puzzle

**Mission Briefing:**
CryptKeepers operatives are hosting several rogue services on this system to communicate with their botnet. We know these services are listening on local TCP ports in the 9000–9100 range. Your mission is to scan the network, identify the active "doors" (ports), and interrogate each service to find the one carrying the valid agency flag.

## 🧠 Intelligence Report
* **The Concept:** **Port Scanning**. Computers use "ports" (numbered 1–65535) to manage network connections. Think of an IP address as a building and ports as the apartment numbers.
* **The Tool:** **Nmap** (Network Mapper). It knocks on every door in a specified range to see which ones are open.
* **The Strategy:**
    1. **Scan:** Find the open ports between 9000 and 9100.
    2. **Connect:** Use `curl` or `nc` (Netcat) to talk to the services running on those ports.
* **The Warning:** Most of the open ports are decoys hosting **fake flags**. You must verify which one is the real flag.

## 📝 Investigator’s Journal
*Notes from the field:*

> "I know they are hiding in the 9000s. If you scan the whole machine, it will take too long. Focus your Nmap scan on `9000-9100`.
> 
> Once you see the open ports, you have to manually check them. Use `curl` or `nc` to interact with the services. When you identify the one transmitting the valid signal, don't just read it—capture it. Redirect the specific output containing the flag into a file named `flag.txt`."

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

You are mapping the digital terrain using these utilities:

| Tool | Purpose | Usage Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **nmap** | The industry standard scanner. `-p` specifies the range. | `nmap -p 9000-9100 localhost` |
| **curl** | Connects to web-based ports (HTTP). | `curl http://localhost:9001` |
| **nc** | "Netcat". Connects to raw TCP ports. Use this if `curl` fails. | `nc localhost 9001` |
| **Output Redirection** | Save your findings to the required file. | `echo "CCRI-AAAA-1111" > flag.txt` |

> 💡 **Tip:** Nmap output looks like this:
> ```text
> PORT      STATE SERVICE
> 9001/tcp open  tor-orport
> 9050/tcp open  tor-socks
> ```
> Each "open" line is a target you need to investigate.

## 🏁 Flag Format
**`CCRI-AAAA-1111`**

Scan the range, interrogate the ports, and identify the true flag.
