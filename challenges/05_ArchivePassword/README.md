# 🔐 Challenge 05: ZIP File Crack & Decode

**Mission Briefing:**
You have recovered a mysterious ZIP archive: `secret.zip`. It is password-protected, and standard extraction methods fail without the key.

However, during the data recovery, we also found a `wordlist.txt` file containing thousands of potential passwords.

## 🧠 Intelligence Report
* **The Lock:** Standard ZIP encryption.
* **The Strategy:** **Dictionary Attack**. This involves automating the process of trying every single word in a list until one works.
* **The Requirement:** You cannot do this by hand. You must use an automated script or tool to try the passwords rapidly.
* **The Warning:** The recovered file contains **multiple flag candidates**. You must determine which one is the real flag.

**Your Goal:** Execute a dictionary attack to crack the password, extract the archive, and decode the flag inside.

## 📂 Files in This Folder

* `wordlist.txt`: A list of common passwords to attempt.
