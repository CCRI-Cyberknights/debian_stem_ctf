# 📜 Challenge 08: Log Analysis Challenge

**Mission Briefing:**
A server has been compromised. The system administrators have provided the `auth.log` file, which records every login attempt. The file contains thousands of lines of noise. Somewhere in there, a hacker successfully logged in or executed a suspicious command.

## 🧠 Intelligence Report
* **The Problem:** The log file is too large to read line-by-line.
* **The Needle:** We are looking for the agency flag format (`CCRI-...`) or suspicious pattern matches.
* **The Strategy:** **Filtering**. Instead of reading everything, we display only the lines that match our criteria.
* **The Warning:** The log contains **decoy entries** designed to mislead investigators.

**Your Goal:** Filter the noise to identify the specific log entry that contains the valid flag.

## 📂 Files in This Folder
* `auth.log`: A large server log file containing thousands of entries.
